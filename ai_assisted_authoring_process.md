# AI-assisted Authoring Process:

- **Foundation in Traditional Writing Principles:**  
  - **Audience & Purpose First:** Establish who you're writing for and why before engaging any tools. This sets the tone, style, and direction for the work.
  
- **Defining the Interaction with AI:**  
  - **Personality Scripts:** Develop clear, tailored instructions (or “agents”) for the AI to ensure it aligns with your expectations. Use different agents for different tasks—ideation, drafting, refining—without letting AI take full control.
  - **Iterative Process:** Start with a rough outline (or bullet points) generated in collaboration with AI (e.g., an 80/20 AI/human draft) and progressively refine it until it reflects more of your own voice (e.g., 20/80).
  
- **Research and Organization:**  
  - **Diverse Research Tools:** Use both traditional methods (Google, academic sources) and AI-powered tools (like Perplexity) to gather and verify information, mitigating systemic bias.
  - **Repository & Notetaking:** Establish a flexible organizational system—whether a digital folder, notebookllm, Obsidian, or mind-mapping tool—to manage your research and ideas effectively.

- **Feedback and Quality Assurance:**  
  - **Multiple Review Checkpoints:** Integrate both automated tools (AI detectors, summarizers) and human/peer review to ensure accuracy, coherence, and authenticity.
  - **Risk & Disclosure Considerations:**  
    - Use a risk matrix to decide the level of disclosure about AI involvement based on the content's potential impact.
    - Balance transparency with quality; in high-stakes writing, human oversight must dominate.
  
- **Balance and Human Oversight:**  
  - **Critical Evaluation:** Remember the GIGO (garbage in, garbage out) principle. AI can provide structure and ideas, but without your judgment and corrections, it may lead to flawed output.
  - **Maintaining Your Voice:** In a landscape of heavy AI use, the authentic human touch—even if imperfect—can stand out. Embrace iterative refinement and use human review to keep your unique perspective intact.
